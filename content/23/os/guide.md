Are you an aspiring developer looking for an exciting and fulfilling summer opportunity? Do you have a passion for open-source projects and a desire to learn from experienced mentors? If your answer is a resounding "yes," then Google Summer of Code (GSoC) might just be the perfect journey for you!

## **What is GSoC?**

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an online program by Google that connects students with open-source organizations. Students can apply to work on a specific project with an organization during their summer break. They receive guidance and feedback from their mentors, as well as a stipend from Google.

But, like any adventure, GSoC requires careful planning and preparation. In this blog post, I'll guide you through the essential steps to make your GSoC journey a rewarding and enriching experience.

## **Find Your Passion**

The first step in your GSoC journey is to identify your areas of interest. Ask yourself:

- What skills do you currently possess or wish to acquire?
- Which open-source organizations align with your interests or curiosity?
- What type of project excites you the most?

You can explore keywords or topics that pique your curiosity on the internet or social media platforms. Additionally, joining online forums or chat groups related to open source or specific technologies can provide valuable insights from fellow enthusiasts.

## **Choose Your Organizations**

Once you've pinpointed your interests, it's time to find open-source organizations that resonate with you. In the beginning, consider selecting only one organizations to focus your efforts on.

To get started, join the mailing lists of these organizations and immerse yourself in their development channels, such as Slack, Discord, IRC, or Zulip. Reading about past GSoC projects and proposals will give you a better understanding of their expectations.

## **Make Your First Contact**

Making your first contact with an organization can be a thrilling experience. Let's use an example to illustrate this step: Imagine you've chosen the Chromium Project.

- Start by cloning the project locally from the [Chromium website](https://source.chromium.org/chromium) on your machine and carefully read the readme file or [instructions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/linux/build_instructions.md).
- While working on the project, if you encounter issues or typos, don't hesitate to raise a pull request.
- Be humble and ask legitimate questions. Remember that mentors are often busy but will appreciate your initiative.

- Introduce yourself and explain why you want to contribute to their project.

## **Find the Right Project**

Each organization typically has a list of project ideas they plan to work on. Begin your search by exploring these projects. Once you've identified a project that aligns with your interests and tech stack, engage with the mentors.

Share your thoughts on the project and inquire about the progress made so far and the project's future direction. The sooner you apply, the greater your chances of success.

## **Dive into the Project**

With a project in mind, it's time to roll up your sleeves and start working. In our example, let's say you're passionate about "TensorFlow" Here's what you can do:

- Join the TensorFlow mailing list or developer chat group.
- Explore the project and understand it's pre-working by other developers.
- Contact the project mentor **only** if you find difficulty in understanding the project's requirements and how to proceed.
- Begin working on the project, dedicating time and effort to understanding its intricacies.

## **Craft Your Proposal**

A well-crafted proposal is crucial to your GSoC application. Your proposal should include:

- Name and contact information
- Project title
- Synopsis
- Benefits to the open-source community
- Deliverables
- Related work
- Biographical information

Start working on your proposal early and seek feedback from your mentor to improve it.

## **Submit Your Proposal Early**

Submitting your proposal early is essential. This allows time for mentor feedback and revisions. Your mentor can guide you on how to refine your proposal for the best chances of acceptance.

## **Embrace the Journey**

Remember that GSoC is not just about coding; it's an opportunity to learn, collaborate, and network with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Patience is key when interacting with mentors, and staying positive and respectful fosters a constructive community.

## **What If You're Not Accepted?**

If you're not selected for GSoC, don't lose heart. Open-source communities offer various avenues for contributions. Stay engaged with your chosen organization by participating in their weekly calls and continuing to work on their projects. Your persistence can pay off in the long run.

#### Keep trying

Just keep trying. The next proposal just might be accepted…

> “Never give up. It took me 3 years and 12 proposals to finally get into the program. If none of your proposals gets accepted, sit back and relax. You have a whole year ahead to improve your role with the open-source community by writing more code.”

In conclusion, embarking on a GSoC journey can be immensely rewarding, but it requires dedication and careful planning. Find your passion, choose your organizations wisely, and embrace the learning experience. Whether you become a GSoC student or not, the world of open source is rich with opportunities to contribute, learn, and grow. So, take the first step towards your open-source adventure today!
